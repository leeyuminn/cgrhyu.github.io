## Abstract
We present a technique for controlling physically simulated characters using user inputs from an off-the-shelf depth camera. Our controller takes a real-time stream of user poses as input, and simulates a stream of target poses of a biped based on it. The simulated biped mimics the user's actions while moving forward at a modest speed and maintaining balance. The controller is parameterized over a set of modulated reference motions that aims to cover the range of possible user actions. For real-time simulation, the best set of control parameters for the current input pose is chosen from the parameterized sets of pre-computed control parameters via a regression method. By applying the chosen parameters at each moment, the simulated biped can imitate a range of user actions while walking in various interactive scenarios.
